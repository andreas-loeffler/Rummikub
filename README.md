# Rummikub

This project is a digital version of the game Rummikub made in our software-engineering class WS20 at HTWG Konstanz.
## Description

The goal of the game is to get rid of all your tiles to win the round.
You can only get rid of your tile's in certain combinations.
If you win a round you get the value of all your opponents remaining tiles as points.
If you lose a round, the value of your remaining tiles get subtracted from your points.
When the game is over the player with the most points wins the game.
